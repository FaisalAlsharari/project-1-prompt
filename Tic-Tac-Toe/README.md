I found it really interesting, fun , and exciting  for my first game.! My fun part started with css and how i can change the size to diffrent phons  then  html, but for the js it was cool but lettl hardthanking about the how to start the game , I also, have my Wireframe and it was so different how I did it at first bbefore even i write a code and now ! Also, I love how website has interesting things such as 
#![sweetalert](https://sweetalert.js.org/) , (https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/

If i still have time i would make it better and more esayer
