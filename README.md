# Tic-tac-toe
Tic-tac-toe is a two player game that takes turn marking spaces on a 3 by 3 grid, and the objective of the game is to place three connecting marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. Tic-tac-toe is one of the first games to be played by children due to its fast setup and easy engagement. Also, I love how website has interesting things such as
